🌐 SPLTRR Website Brief
✅ About SPLTRR
SPLTRR is a next-gen payment platform designed to simplify group payments. Whether it’s friends splitting a dinner bill, roommates sharing utilities, or teams co-buying gifts, SPLTRR ensures everyone pays their fair share—effortlessly, fairly, and transparently.

We are entering the e-commerce space as a payment solution, enabling online merchants to offer “split payment” at checkout. Think Klarna or PayPal, but for groups.

Communicate SPLTRR's value proposition clearly and quickly.

Build trust and excitement with clean, modern visuals.

Encourage sign-ups (waitlist or beta access).

Educate both individual users and e-commerce merchants.

Provide a smooth UX with responsive design (mobile-first).
